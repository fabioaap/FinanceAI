# ✨ Welcome to Your Spark Template!
You've just launched your brand-new Spark Template Codespace — everything’s fired up and ready for you to explore, build, and create with Spark!

This template is your blank canvas. It comes with a minimal setup to help you get started quickly with Spark development.

🚀 What's Inside?
- A clean, minimal Spark environment
- Pre-configured for local development
- Ready to scale with your ideas
This template implements the UI and local persistence wiring for a FinanceAI MVP, but lacks the full sync, OAuth and import features described in the project specification. See `docs/scan_spec_report.md` for a detailed mapping.

📦 Como começar (instalar Dexie localmente)

Para habilitar o banco local (Dexie) e rodar o projeto a partir do root do repositório, execute:

```bash
# instalar dependências do monorepo
npm install

# rodar no modo de desenvolvimento
npm run dev
```
  
🧠 What Can You Do?

Right now, this is just a starting point — the perfect place to begin building and testing your Spark applications.

🧹 Just Exploring?
No problem! If you were just checking things out and don’t need to keep this code:

- Simply delete your Spark.
- Everything will be cleaned up — no traces left behind.
